        <h1>The Importance of Physical Health</h1>
        <p>Taking care of yourself isn't always easy. There are times when you see your schedule so occupied that you feel like self-care could never make it into your schedule. Yet, in times like these when you are most occupied is when you need to self-care.</p>
        <p>Having lots of responsibilities can make you feel overwhelmed. Time becomes your enemy. You feel like you must use each minute wisely or you won't get anything done. For these kinds of moments when time is constantly on your back you need to have mental self-care time to relax and not over-stress.</p>
        <p>Mental self-care will redirect your negative thoughts to positive ones. It can help you value the things around you and the things you do. For example, when before you thought getting one word into your essay wasn't worth anything now you will see it as success in progress. Sometimes we just need to slow down and make some pauses before continuing with our daily responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Mental Self-Care can help in many ways like: enhance health, enhance well being, manage stress and lower chances of developing anxiety and depression.</p>
