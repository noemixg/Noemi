         <h1>The Importance of Self-Care</h1>
<p>Self-care is taking care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally. It is often seen or perceived as being selfish, but in reality it is helping you live in the moment and enjoy life. This is important because in order for you to help others you must first help yourself. </p>

            <h3>Self-Care Routine</h3>
            <p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                One of the hardest things when it comes to self-care is taking the time to actually do it. Just like a garden takes watering, sunlight, and oxygen, so do we. We need a daily input to grow as people, to give our 100%.
